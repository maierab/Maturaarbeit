# KanaKards

A simple flashcard system intended for practicing active recall of the Japanese hiragana alphabet.

### Guide:
Symbols can be looked up in the "reference chart" page, which is accessed via the main menu.

The "start flashcards" button will lead to the page where the actual cards are. 
By default both basic and voiced consonants are shown in alphabetical order. To change this, the options menu can be opened from the cards page by clicking the icon in the top right corner. When any settings are changed, the deck will automatically restart from the beginning.
